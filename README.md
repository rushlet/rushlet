# Hi, I'm Becky.
Inspired by other Developer READMEs, I decided to make my own.
This document exists in the hopes of optimising how we work together, because I really do want to work with/for you in the best way for both of us.
It should also give you a bit of insight about what makes me tick as a human.

## How to work with Becky

### My work hours:
I'm a morning person, for the most part.<br  />
**I try to get into the office between 8-8.30am and will stick around til 4-5pm.**<br />
This is actually mostly to avoid busyness on the roads/darkness when I'm cycling or manic overcrowding public transport. <br />
Outside of these times if you ask me a question on Slack, I will try and respond in a vaguely helpful way.<br />

### What's the best way to communicate with me?
*Slack > in person > email > text (the old fashioned sort if you want me to reply fairly quickly because WhatsApp doesn't play nicely with my phone)*

Generally, **Slack is best**. Don't be offended if I don't reply straight away - I'm probably in the middle of something.

I'm a big **fan of face to face** - it's generally quicker and less room for misunderstanding.  <br />
Even if you 'only have a quick question', I'd prefer it if you **Slack me before coming over** - this is especially true if I have headphones on.
I get that you might need an answer asap but I might be just about to crack this coding problem, and it can be really hard to get my head back into that space.


**If I don't respond**, try: Slacking me again - I probably got distracted and forgot to reply. Or, catch me in the kitchen.

### I'd love to help you with...
Anything, really.

* If you have a logic problem, I'd like to talk it out with you.
* If you have a coding problem, I'm happy to take a look and see if we can figure it out together.
* If you have a bug you can't fix, I want to figure it out (it makes me feel like a detective).
* If you want to talk about usage data & istats, I'm your person (it's probably the detective thing again).

### What makes me grumpy?
* People interrupting my conversations with others to 'ask a quick question' - what you have to say is no more or less important than the person I am talking to. Slack me, wait, or come back when I am free.
* Wet shoes
* Being tired and hungry (I may not always realise this is the cause of my grumpiness)
* Tiny pockets in women's jeans
* Forgetting my headphones (especially on public transport)

### How do I like to give feedback?
Depends on the feedback, but probably in person. Text communication gets misinterpreted.

### How do I like to receive feedback?
Again, it depends, but usually in person - I have a tendency to overanalyse text.

### What do I want from a code review?
I like code reviews. They're one of the main ways I find myself improving as a developer.<br  />
If you're code reviewing my work, please:
* Leave constructive criticism - if there's a better way of doing something, I want to know! Especially if it a nice ES6 solution I've overlooked.
* Be available for me to ask for clarification (either on github, in person or on slack)
* Tell me if you see something you particularly like - an ego boost never hurts!

### One of my goals for the coming year:
* Present at a conference (eek!)

### Topics I'm always happy to talk about:
* Music. Any recommendations? What gigs have you been to recently?
* TV shows - from the ridiculously brilliant to the brilliantly ridiculous. I especially appreciate _those_ cop dramas (_Castle, Lucifer, The Mentalist,_ I'm looking at you)
* Invitations & recommendations of things to see and do in London - I'm still really new here!
* The idiosyncrasies of the English language - why are you _on_ a plane but _in_ a taxi?
* Where I should go on my next adventure

### Other things you might want to know:
* I bruise easily & I'm clumsy, you probably shouldn't be concerned if I look like I've been beaten up.
* My music taste is pretty eclectic, I can bounce from [ukranian folk](https://open.spotify.com/track/52Wl3PQGfyvMJm5JQu0acD?si=zEoFqkZ3Qqe2IRLWeFQC1Q) to [90s indie rock](https://open.spotify.com/track/1OU3fzC6uWKpqgZalfUSx8?si=vCywFj1VT9yR9kCjrXYxAw) to [Brazilian body percussian](https://open.spotify.com/track/4bndkI1TTh7itdsyixtDoD?si=CvQIUFxXQImKE73oJsBhOw) to [acoustic covers of pop songs](https://open.spotify.com/track/5CjOsESIfgyByBGKL7MCWU?si=S0_UprYXQHmEm2sU4FWU-w) before breakfast.
* My face is sometimes more expressive than I realise, it can get me into trouble.
* I hit a drum fairly well in a [Brighton based samba band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRHbofgZmq0), sometimes this involves wandering the streets in fantastic costumes and perplexing passers by.
* On a related note, I love any excuse for fancy dress.
* My birthday: 14th September.
* My coffee order: Decaf iced latte or decaf oat milk latte (decaf iced oat when I can accept how pretentious I sound).
* My hometown: Brighton. Some people think that explains a lot.
* ~Sports~ Musical loyalties: [Iron & Wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZIwLR426Mo&feature=youtu.be&t=2013), [The Decemberists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Jz3tMddw4&t=3102s) and [The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdFCD3oXMZo&t=540s).
